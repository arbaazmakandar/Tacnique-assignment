## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm install && npm run start`



## The Challenges faced by me during the project were:

1. The form was not updating correctly on edit and adding of user. I realized I was not putting the data correctly. I used console.logs do find the error and accordingly updated the code.

2. To break down the component structure, I first wrote the code in table format and later designed components for it.

3. The POST and PUT API were not working initially because the data format is not accpting department so I used phone key to store the department value and updated accordingly.
